            <div class="mbr-text counter-container col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-5">
                <div><strong><br></strong></div><ul>
                    <li><strong>Arrival Time:</strong>&nbsp; Please arrive five minutes early for your appointment. &nbsp;The time set aside for your appointment is completely yours. &nbsp; If you are late to your scheduled session, you are missing out on your massage time. &nbsp;The session will still end at the regularly scheduled time and the full cost of the session will be expected as the time was set aside for you.
</li><li><strong>Cancellations:</strong>&nbsp; 12-hour advance notice is required, failure to cancel within the 12-hour window before your scheduled appointment may result in a 50% cancellation fee (half the cost of the session).  This amount must be paid prior to your next scheduled appointment.  Cancellations will be accepted online up to 12-hours before your appointment.   If something comes up last minute, please contact us and immediately via text message at 602-402-5402 so you are not considered a "no show". 
</li><li><strong>No-Shows:</strong>&nbsp; Anyone who either forgets or consciously chooses to forego their scheduled appointment for whatever reason will be considered a "no-show" and will be liable for the full amount of the booked  session. &nbsp;This amount must be paid prior to your next scheduled appointment. 
</li><li><strong>Contraindications: &nbsp;</strong>There are certain medical conditions where massage/bodywork may not be advised, or is contraindicated. &nbsp;Such situations include present fever indicating infection, contagious conditions, or situations where massage could potentially be harmful to a clientâ€™s condition. &nbsp;We reserve the right to decline massage treatment in such situations. 
</li><li><strong>Forms of payment accepted:</strong>&nbsp; Cash, Debit Card, Visa, MasterCard, AMEX and Discover are all acceptable forms of payment. &nbsp;We also take FSA and HSA cards. &nbsp;We do not handle insurance claims or forms, but will be happy to supply you with a receipt for you to submit to your insurance company for possible reimbursement. 
</li><li><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong>&nbsp; Your privacy is very important. &nbsp;Your information will be kept completely confidential and will not be shared with anyone unless you have given written consent to share with other health care providers. 
</li><li>
<strong>Confidentiality:</strong>&nbsp; The discussion between client and massage therapist, is completely confidential. &nbsp;You may choose to talk during the massage and you may not. &nbsp;The only information ever shared is if by court order and only your session records would be released which may or may not have notes pertaining to discussions that have taken place between client and therapist. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Client Boundaries/Feedback:</strong>&nbsp; We respect your boundaries and understand that there may be situations that are uncomfortable for you. &nbsp;Feedback is very important as it helps you get the most out of your visit. &nbsp;Please don't be afraid to speak up and let us know if we employ any massage techniques that make you uncomfortable, and it is equally important to share anything that you particularly do enjoy. 
</li><li><strong>Comfort &amp; Possible Concerns:</strong>&nbsp; You should undress to <em>your</em> comfort level. &nbsp;If you are not comfortable you will not be able to relax. &nbsp;You reserve the right to stay completely dressed, undress to your undergarments, or completely undress. &nbsp;You will be draped by a sheet and/or blanket at all times. &nbsp;Only the area being worked will be undraped. &nbsp;The therapist will always leave the room while you get on/off the table and makes sure you are fully covered before re-entering. &nbsp;Breast and genital areas will not be massaged under any circumstance. &nbsp;No sexual discussion, interaction, or innuendo is tolerated and is never appropriate. &nbsp; If at any time the client or the therapist feels uncomfortable, we both respectfully reserve the right to immediately end the session. &nbsp;We hold our massage practices to a very high standard.   &nbsp;
</li><li><strong>Sanitation &amp; Hygiene:</strong>&nbsp; All equipment and linens that come in contact with clients will be cleansed and sanitized in an appropriate and approved method. &nbsp;All lotion and oil is dispensed in a contamination-free manner. &nbsp;Before and after each massage, the therapist will sanitize and wash hands and forearms. &nbsp;Any breaks in the therapist skin will be covered with protective coverings. &nbsp;Clients are expected to come to the session clean and will inform the therapist of any breaks in their skin so the areas may be avoided and/or the therapist may choose to wear gloves. &nbsp;Hygiene is important to us as well as it is to you.
</li><li><strong>Breathing:</strong>&nbsp; Breathing during massage is very beneficial; it helps carry oxygen to your muscles and assists in release. &nbsp;Breathing can also be a good way to communicate to your therapist without having to speak. &nbsp;Deep breaths throughout the session and especially on extremely tense areas is encouraged. 
</li><li><strong>Water Intake:</strong>&nbsp; The consumption of water after a massage is very important. &nbsp;Because toxins are released from your soft tissue during massage, it is recommended that you drink plenty of water following your massage to flush these toxins from your system.   Following this simple instruction of water consumption will help alleviate any toxins resettling in your system and causing any unnecessary soreness. 
</li><li><strong>Informed Notice:</strong>&nbsp; Please note that we reserve the right to decline service at any time, at our discretion.</li></ul><ul>
